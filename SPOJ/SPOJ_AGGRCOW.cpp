/*
General Idea: In this problem we can apply binary search, in order to find the maximum minimum distance between cows
If we search between 1 (on the situation we have cows occuping all places) and lastIndex - firstIndex (in case we only have 2 cows) we
will get the max min distance between cows

Time Complexity: O(n* log(n))
